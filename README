HOW TO REQUEST DATA FROM MICROSERVICE:

To programmatically request data from the microservice implemented in server.js, utilize an HTTP 
client library like axios in JavaScript. Send an HTTP GET request to the desired endpoint, handle 
the response to obtain the requested data, and ensure to implement error handling for any potential issues.

HOW TO RECIEVE DATA FROM THE MICROSERVICE:

To programmatically interact with the microservice implemented in server.js, you'll utilize HTTP 
requests. Determine the endpoints you need to access: / for retrieving HTML content and /update-theme 
for updating the theme setting. Send an HTTP GET request to / to receive the settings page HTML, and 
handle the response appropriately. For updating the theme, send an HTTP POST request to /update-theme 
with the new theme data.
